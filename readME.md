`Mochawesome generates new report for every spec we have. And since by default it overwrites old reports, this means it will only keep last test spec run. This we can fix by setting overwrite flag to false. Changing this flag to false would just generate new file at each run. So you should delete old ones before running, manually or by using some script.`
