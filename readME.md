### Challenges i faced
- `{ uncaught:exceptions }`, were failing my test only on firefix, all other browsers were passing my tests

- sorting the high/low results, trying to make the parent()
 selector available so that i can have access to the choldren selectors

- finding a suitable framework for test reporting taht works seamlessly with cypress (mochaawesome_generator)

### Things to improve on Cypress Automation Framework
1. pageObject file, defined variables can be organised in alphabetical order
2. currently strings are hard coded on the test files, all strings can be stored under one .env file (dotenv package manager) and called upon
3.  



## Test results report using mocha-awesome-reporter

test script would do the following:
a. run your test suite
b. create 'mocha' folder under 'cypress/reports'
c. create .json files (one for each spec executed) in the 'mocha' folder

posttest script would combine all the .json files present in 'cypress/reports/mocha' folder and place the combined file 'report.json' in 'cypress/reports/mochareports' and create a beautiful html report.
